{1111} in mind in bringing Ubuntu to the phone. It offers great performance on handsets with a low bill of materials, while opening up new opportunities for phone and PC convergence at the top end of the market. And its amazing user experience can be tailored to your brand, integrating your custom services, content and apps.
-----

=====
{1112} Ubuntu provides a fast and beautiful experience, even on inexpensive hardware. It doesn’t have the overhead of a Java virtual machine, so all core applications run at full native speeds with a small memory footprint. That gives the UI a luxurious, responsive feel without the requirement of premium hardware components.
-----
即使在廉价设备上，Ubuntu依然能够提供快速、优雅的使用体验。Ubuntu中所有的核心程序不依赖于Java虚拟机，因此他们能够在设备上全速运行，且占用更少内存。
=====
{1113} And on the high end, Ubuntu paves the way for a new category of superphones, with a full PC desktop accessible just by docking the device to a monitor and keyboard. A truly handheld PC is the future of personal computing.
-----
通过带键盘和显示器的扩展插槽，Ubuntu定义了智能手机的全新使用方式，完美的桌面级PC使用体验。
=====
{1114} High-end smartphones have a brain as powerful as ultra-light laptops. Ubuntu uniquely enables a new category of convergence device – phones that dock to become full PCs and thin clients – enabling enterprise IT departments to replace phones, thin clients and laptops with a single secure corporate device.
-----

=====
{1115} Operators targeting the enterprise market with LTE can now deliver a full laptop/phone solution, with Windows apps delivered over LTE from the corporate data center. And operators in emerging markets can deliver desktop applications to the converged device over LTE as a premium data service.
-----

=====
{1117} Content can be surfaced in the home screen and search, apps can be pre-installed and there are ample opportunities for branding the device. With an extensible cloud framework on every Ubuntu device, you can deliver custom services to your audience that fit neatly into a global cloud ecosystem.
-----

=====
{1118} HTML5 is fully supported but Ubuntu is not limited to HTML5. To use the full power of the hardware, you can develop native apps, using OpenGL and QML, with C or C++ and Javascript compiled for extra performance.
-----
为了展现硬件的全部性能，Ubuntu不仅全面支持HTML5，同时支持通过C、C++和Javascript开发的本地应用。
=====
{1119} We have teams based in Taipei, Shanghai, London, Beijing and Boston to engage with your engineering and factory operations – and their sole focus is to deliver a crisp Ubuntu experience on your device.
-----

=====
{1120} Ubuntu has already been adapted to run on chipsets using the ARM and Intel x86 architectures relevant for mobile devices, with the core system based around a typical Android Board Support Package (BSP). So chipset vendors and hardware manufacturers do not need to invest in or maintain new hardware support packages for Ubuntu on smartphones. In short, if you already make handsets that run Android, the work needed to adopt Ubuntu will be trivial.
-----

=====
{1121} Ubuntu is already used in over 70 countries and has been translated into over 40 languages. With 20 million desktop users around the world, it is both an established platform and an established global brand.
-----

=====
{1122} Canonical is the global software vendor that provides commercial and design support to the Ubuntu project. Today, our hardware enablement team supports the pre-installation of Ubuntu on millions of new PCs shipped worldwide, annually.
-----

=====
{1440} Operators have room to enhance Ubuntu with their own services, content, apps and branding without breaking compatibility with the broader Ubuntu app ecosystem. Canonical engages with OEMs and operators to enable them to ship phones with custom capabilities or offer exclusive items for their audience.
